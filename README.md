# Hello ScalikeJDBC!

This is an example app to demonstrate how to create a [Play](https://playframework.com/) application using [ScalikeJDBC](http://scalikejdbc.org/) and [play-flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway-play).

NOTICE: Formerly, this repository was a [Lightbend Activator](http://www.lightbend.com/activator/) template for ScalikeJDBC beginners. But Activator was EOL-ed on May 24, 2017. Thus, the repository is not an Activator template but an example app now

## ScalikeJDBC

https://github.com/scalikejdbc/scalikejdbc

A tidy SQL-based DB access library for Scala developers. This library naturally wraps JDBC APIs and provides you easy-to-use APIs.

## Play Framework 2.x

https://www.playframework.com/

Play Framework makes it easy to build web applications with Java & Scala. Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture.

Built on Akka, Play provides predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications.

### play-flyway

https://github.com/flyway/flyway-play

Flyway plugin for Play2. It aims to be a substitute for play-evolutions.

### play-json4s

https://github.com/tototoshi/play-json4s

This module allows you to use json4s in your Play2 apps.

## Backbone.js

http://backbonejs.org/

Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

## CoffeeScript

http://coffeescript.org/

CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
